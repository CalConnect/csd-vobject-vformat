=== Additional Server Semantics for PUT, COPY and MOVE

This specification creates an additional precondition and postcondition
for the PUT, COPY, and MOVE methods when:

* A PUT operation requests an address object resource to be placed into
  an address book collection; and

* A COPY or MOVE operation requests an address object resource to be
  placed into (or out of) an address book collection.


==== Provide Normalized Output

Certain servers perform silent changes or cleanups of client provided
vCard data when stored as address object resources, such as the order of
property parameters or scrubbed values.

The resulting vCard data stored on the server (and when returned back to
the client) *MAY* end up different than that of the client without its
knowledge. It is therefore necessary for the client to be reported on
such modifications.
